TODO
====

- convert Entity from transform to position (vec3), orientation (quat) and 
  scale (vec3).
- deferred rendering. (primarily lighting)
- validate lighting code. (specular looks funky and directional has 
  angles in diffuse)
- add sound
- add simple physics (for prediction and effects)
- unit tests (as far as sensible)
- extract examples to separate project (licensing/copyright issues)
